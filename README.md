# AsteroidBreaker-TheBricksGame

This is my space-themed "Bricks" game project, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a grid of asteroids (bricks) that the player must clear by reboumding a star. The interface includes interactive controls such as Start, Pause, Stop, and Reset Result, along with a difficulty selector and real-time timer and score display. The game also includes animated visual effects like a moving stars in the background.
